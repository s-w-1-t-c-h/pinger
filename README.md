# pinger

Basic threaded ICMP discovery script, written in Python 3. Should work across Windows/Linux/OSX, but haven't tested extensively. Technically, pinger can scan Class B or A ranges but I'd use a pro tool for that if I were you.

# Requirements

Compatible with Python 3. Just needs the netaddr package:

```
pip3 install netaddr
```
# Usage

Pretty basic, good enough for CTF or lab use.
